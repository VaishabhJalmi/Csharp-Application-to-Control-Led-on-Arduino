# Csharp-Application-to-Control-Led-on-Arduino

C# Application for Controlling LED with Arduino

This repository contains a C# application that enables control of an LED connected to an Arduino board. The application allows users to turn the LED on and off using a graphical user interface. It utilizes the serial communication capabilities of the Arduino to send commands from the C# application to the microcontroller. This project serves as a practical example of integrating software and hardware through a simple but effective interface.
